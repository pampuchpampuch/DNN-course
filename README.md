# DNN-course

Projects completed as a part of Deep Neural Networks university course.
Tasks were provided as a general outline with classes or functions to implement. Not all code is mine.

## RevNet_backprop

The point of the task was to deepen my understanding of backprop algorithm, so only numpy was used in this implementation. Uses [ClearML](https://clear.ml/) functionalities for models tuning management.

## transformer

The goal was to implement decoder only transformer with new and well regarded posistional encoding method - Rotary Positional Embedding (RoPE) and different sampling methods.

## visual anomaly detection

Investigates the method of visual anomaly detection intoduced in [PADIM paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08785.pdf) and verifies the approaches used.
